# 🔍 Cosine Similarity Text Matching in Python

This project demonstrates how to use **Cosine Similarity** to compare the similarity between text documents using **TF-IDF** in Python. It's built to run seamlessly on **Google Colab** and is perfect for beginners in NLP, Machine Learning, or Search Systems.

## 📚 Project Overview

Cosine similarity measures the **angle between two text vectors**. The smaller the angle, the more similar the texts are.

This project covers:
- 🧮 Converting text into vectors using **TF-IDF**
- 📐 Calculating pairwise **cosine similarity**
- 🧾 Displaying the similarity in a clean matrix format
